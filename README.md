# Global Nuclear Weapons Map

An interactive globe of every nuclear weapon on Earth: **who has them, how many, where they are physically
kept, what they would do — and how the arsenals rose and fell from 1938 to 2026.**

## What it shows

| | |
|---|---|
| **Countries** | Coloured by nuclear status, warhead count, total megatonnage, democracy score, tests conducted, when they got the bomb, warheads per head of population, or treaty commitments. |
| **Sites** | **633 mapped sites, 609 with real coordinates**, across **55 countries** — silo fields, submarine and bomber bases, warhead stores, enrichment plants, reprocessing lines, weapons labs, uranium mines, test sites, early-warning radars and the rest of the command network, weapons lost at sea, the places the fallout landed, and former or dismantled facilities. |
| **Colour = certainty** | 🟢 declared arsenal · 🟡 undeclared but universally assessed (Israel) · 🔴 pursuing or threshold (Iran) · 🔵 hosting another state's weapons (Belgium, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Türkiye, Belarus) · 🟣 built the bomb and gave it up (South Africa, Ukraine, Kazakhstan). Countries that ran a programme and stopped, and countries that once hosted foreign weapons, are separate categories — the distinctions matter. |
| **Shape = kind of site** | ● deployed weapons · ■ storage · ◆ making the bomb · ▲ test site · ○ warning &amp; command · ◆ lost at sea · ✚ where it landed on people · ○ former/dismantled. |
| **Owner flags** | Where one country's weapons sit on another's soil — US B61s at Incirlik, Kleine Brogel, Büchel, Ghedi, Aviano, Volkel and Lakenheath; Russian weapons at Asipovichy in Belarus — the marker flies the **owner's** flag, because those warheads are not the host's. |
| **Fissile material** | Two views of the same dataset, with a toggle: how many **tonnes** of weapon-usable material each country holds (highly enriched uranium and separated plutonium), and **how many weapons that material could make** at the IAEA significant quantity — 25 kg of HEU or 8 kg of plutonium, or a modern design's 15 kg / 4 kg. Filter to HEU, plutonium, or military stocks only. |
| **Megatonnage badges** | A 💥 sized by each country's total explosive yield, so you can see at a glance who holds the most destructive power — not just the most warheads. |
| **Timeline** | Scrub or play 1938 → 2026. Watch military stockpiles peak at 64,452 warheads in 1986 and fall back, South Africa's six bombs appear in 1979 and vanish in 1991 — shown as an *undeclared* arsenal, which is what it was — and Ukraine's inherited weapons go home to Russia. |
| **Detonation simulator** | Standard published effect radii for any warhead on any city — fireball, blast, burns, prompt radiation, fallout plume, crater, casualty ranges, shockwave arrival times. Or place a country's **entire arsenal** on the world's largest cities. |
| **Reach rings** | How far each state's missiles actually get, drawn from where the arsenal really sits. |
| **Filtering** | Click a row in the key to narrow the whole map — countries, markers, event pins and the ranking list — to that category, and it stays narrowed until cleared. Combine rows, clear with the button or Esc, and share the filtered view by link. |

The fissile layer is the one that changes how the map reads. Japan holds 44.5 tonnes of civil plutonium and no
weapons — enough material for about **5,600**. The UK's Sellafield stockpile is worth roughly **15,900**. The
world holds enough for about **120,000 weapons** and has built around **12,000**. North Korea is marked with a
`+`: its enrichment output is not published, so its figure is a floor rather than a total.

Also inside: **241 timeline events**, all **2,056 nuclear tests**, **134 delivery systems**, **15 treaties** with
where each stands in 2026, national **fissile-material stockpiles**, **threshold assessments** for every state
without weapons ("how close are they?"), and a **"what we're least sure about"** panel carrying **125
uncertainties in the researchers' own words**.

## Nothing here is secret

Every location, number and figure comes from published open sources: the **Federation of American
Scientists**' Nuclear Notebook and Status of World Nuclear Forces, the **Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists**,
**SIPRI**, the **Arms Control Association**, the **IAEA**, the **Nuclear Threat Initiative**, the
**International Panel on Fissile Materials**, **CSIS Beyond Parallel** and commercially available satellite
imagery. Most of these sites are photographed from orbit every day.

Warhead counts are **independent analysts' estimates**, not official declarations — most nuclear-armed states
publish little or nothing. Where sources disagree, the map says so, and every site carries a confidence
rating.

**Two numbers get quoted and they are not the same.** The *military stockpile* is the warheads assigned to
the armed forces; the *total inventory* adds those retired but still intact. The timeline plots stockpiles,
because that is the measure published for every year back to 1945; the headline world figure is the
inventory. Both are labelled everywhere they appear rather than silently reconciled.

The effects simulator implements the scaling relations from *The Effects of Nuclear Weapons* (Glasstone &
Dolan, US Government Printing Office, 3rd edn — public domain): a two-dimensional blast model in ground range
and burst height, dual-regime thermal and prompt-radiation slant ranges, Table 9.93 fallout contours with the
effective-wind factor and t^-1.2 decay, and the DCPA/OTA casualty fractions. `tools/validate.cjs` checks the
implementation against **131 published check values** — all pass within 12%.

It is an educational tool. It is not suitable for emergency planning or emergency response, and it is not a
perfect simulation.

## Running it locally

```bash
node tools/serve.cjs . 8761
```

Then open http://127.0.0.1:8761. It needs a web server — opening `index.html` from the filesystem will fail
because the country borders are loaded with `fetch`.

## Rebuilding the data

The data files under `data/` are generated from a research dump:

```bash
node tools/nuke-merge.cjs /path/to/research-json-dir
```

The merge tool normalises every site record; deduplicates on proximity plus a name stem (researchers describe
the same place differently, and matching exact coordinates misses that); collapses consolidated files against
the parts they were assembled from; repairs coordinate sign errors only where a site is more than 500 km
outside its host country; derives the armed, hosting and programme windows; and writes `data/nuclear-data.js`,
`data/sites.js`, `data/history.js` and `data/cities.js`.

Then check it:

```bash
node tools/validate.cjs
```

which point-in-polygon-tests every coordinate against the country it claims, verifies the warhead arithmetic
adds up, and runs the physics against its published check values.

## Layout

```
index.html          the whole app
nuclear.css         theme + layout
nuclear.js          globe, flat map, layers, timeline, cards, search
physics.js          nuclear effects, from the Glasstone & Dolan tables
blast.js            the detonation simulator UI
data/               generated data + Natural Earth country borders
lib/globe.gl.min.js bundled, no CDN
tools/
  nuke-merge.cjs    research JSON -> data/
  validate.cjs      coordinate, arithmetic and physics checks
  extract-gaps.cjs  pulls the researchers' stated uncertainties out of the run
  bump.cjs          version + cache-busters
  deploy.cjs        assemble the publishable file set
  serve.cjs         local static server
```

No build step, no dependencies, no network calls at runtime. Everything is bundled.

## Languages

The header selector supports English (the first-visit default), Chinese, Japanese, Korean and French.
The chosen language is stored locally as `nk_language`; browser locale does not override the default.
Interface text, country/site descriptions, history, charts and simulator output use the bundled dictionaries
in `data/i18n/`. Necessary source citations and some proper names retain their original spelling.
The dictionaries contain machine-translated research prose; technical wording should be reviewed against
the original English sources before formal use. No translation service is called by the running app.

In Chinese mode, mainland China and Taiwan share one `MultiPolygon` map feature and therefore the same
colour, hover, elevation and selection state. Other languages restore the original separate features.
The source GeoJSON and nuclear data remain unchanged.

`i18n.js` retains original text and localizes newly inserted content, tooltips and accessible labels.
When adding visible English text, add its translation to all four JSON dictionaries. Variable templates
use `9876500`, `9876501`, etc. as preserved slots, not literal displayed values.

Run the dependency-free regression checks with:

```bash
node tests/i18n.cjs
```

## Corrections

Data errors are likely in a project this size, and corrections are genuinely welcome — open an issue with a
source.
